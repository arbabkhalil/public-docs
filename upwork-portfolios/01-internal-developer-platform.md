# Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Implementation

## Project Overview

**Client:** AERQ GmbH (Aviation Technology Company)  
**Location:** Hamburg, Germany  
**Duration:** April 2023 - February 2025  
**Role:** Senior DevOps Engineer / Platform Architect

---

## Executive Summary

Led the strategic transformation of a traditional DevOps team into a modern Platform Engineering team by designing and implementing a comprehensive Internal Developer Platform (IDP). This initiative significantly enhanced developer productivity, reduced deployment friction, and established a self-service infrastructure model for the engineering organization.

---

## Business Challenge

AERQ, a company providing digital solutions for the aviation industry, faced several challenges:

- **Slow developer onboarding** - New engineers took weeks to become productive
- **Infrastructure bottlenecks** - DevOps team was a blocker for deployments
- **Inconsistent environments** - Dev, staging, and production drift caused issues
- **Manual processes** - Too much time spent on repetitive infrastructure tasks
- **Security concerns** - Secrets management was fragmented and risky

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Tools:** Terraform, Terragrunt, Atlantis

```

├── terragrunt.hcl              # Root configuration
├── modules/
│   ├── aks-cluster/            # AKS module
│   ├── azure-database/         # Database module
│   ├── storage-account/        # Storage module
│   └── networking/             # VNet, subnets, NSGs
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── production/
└── atlantis.yaml               # PR-based IaC workflow
```

**Key Features:**
- Version-controlled infrastructure changes via PR workflow
- Automated plan/apply with Atlantis integration
- Environment parity through Terragrunt configurations
- Drift detection and remediation

### 2. Kubernetes Platform

**Cluster Configuration:**
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with multiple node pools
- Namespace isolation per environment and team
- Network policies for micro-segmentation
- Pod Security Standards enforcement

**Platform Components Deployed:**
| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| ArgoCD | GitOps-based continuous deployment |
| HashiCorp Vault | Secrets management and dynamic credentials |
| Prometheus Stack | Metrics, alerting, and dashboards |
| External DNS | Automatic DNS record management |
| Cert Manager | Automated TLS certificate provisioning |

### 3. GitOps Workflow

                     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

### 4. Helm Chart Standardization

Created standardized Helm charts for:
- Web applications (frontend)
- API services (backend)
- Background workers
- Scheduled jobs (CronJobs)
